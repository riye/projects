# Personal Unity Projects

## Paw Wars

Paw Wars is meant to be a cross-over between Kirby Mass Attack and Monster Hunter Airou, as a game on mobile. It is currently a work in progress. This was mostly an exercise in designing a small mobile game and learning how to use Unity in 2D. 

#### Gameplay
ASelect the composition of your cat army, and then begin battling bosses. Each type of cat would have specific abilities, but the essentials are: swipe up to launch your cat and avoid ground attacks, or swipe forward to make a cat rush forward and avoid long ranged attacks. Swiping backwards would allow your cat to backflip dodge. All actions would impact all cats in the area that you touched. 

All assets, except the city background image, were created by me.

## HoloChess

Holographic chess game. Again, a work in progress.

This was more an excercise to learn the fundamentals of making a Unity game in 3D, of making a Unity game on HoloLens (gaze, etc.) before the HoloToolkit was a thing, and learning how to create 3D models in Blender and sculpt.
All assets and models, including all chess pieces, (except the anime boy) were created by me using Blender.
